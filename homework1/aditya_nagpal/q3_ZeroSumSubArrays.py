# given:
    ## an array of integers

# question:
    ## return the number of SUBARRAYS that SUM to ZERO.

#solution:

# i = 0
# count = 0
# n = len(arr)
# while( i < n):
    #j = i
    # while(j < n):
        # sum = 0
        # found  = flase
        # for l in range(i, j):
            # sum += arr[l]

        # if sum == 0: 
            #count = count +1
            
        # j += 1
    # i += 1

    #return count
