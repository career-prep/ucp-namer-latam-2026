## Q0: Zero Sum

## Problem Type
Array + Hash Map (Zero-sum pair counting)

## Description
Given an array of integers, count pairs of numbers whose sum is zero.
Two approaches are implemented:
- One where numbers cannot be reused
- One where numbers can be reused to count all valid pairs

## Solution Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Time Spent
- zeroSum: 47 minutes
- zeroSumReuse: 31 minutes

## Q1: Unique Sum

## Problem Type
Array + Set (Unique value aggregation)

## Description
Given an array of integers, compute the sum of all unique elements.
Duplicate values are ignored using a set.

## Solution Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Time Spent
- uniqueSum: 3 minutes

## Q2: First Occurence

## Problem Type
String + Set (First occurrence tracking)

## Description
Given a string, return a new string containing only the first occurrence
of each character while preserving the original order.

## Solution Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
