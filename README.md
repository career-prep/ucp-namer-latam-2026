## Problem 0: Zero Sum Pairs

  ### Time Spent
    36 minutes

  ### Complexity Analysis
     Time complexity = O(n) where n is the number of integer in provided array
     Space complexity = O(n) where n is the size of the hashmap

## Problem 1: Unique Sum

  ### Time Spent
    3 minutes

  ### Complexity Analysis
     * Time complexity = O(n) where n is the number of integer in  provided array
     * Space complexity = O(n) where n is the size of the hashset

## Problem 2: First Occurrence

  ### Time Spent
    8 minutes

  ### Complexity Analysis
       Time complexity = O(n) where n is the length of string
       Space complexity = O(n) where n is the size of the hashset

## Notes
  All solutions are implemented in Java.
